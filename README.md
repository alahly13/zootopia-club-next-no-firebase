# Zootopia Club Next

Zootopia Club Next is the simplified 2026 monorepo rebuild of the Zootopia Club platform.

## Monorepo

- `apps/web`: canonical Next.js 16.2.2 App Router application inside the monorepo
- `apps/api`: future extraction boundary, no live traffic in the current runtime shape
- `packages/shared-config`: app constants, routes, feature flags, model catalog
- `packages/shared-types`: shared request, response, auth, document, assessment, infographic, and admin types
- `packages/shared-utils`: pure helpers, RTL helpers, upload policy, validation
- `firebase`: Firestore and Storage rules

The project root is the monorepo manager only. It intentionally does not act as a second Next.js app.

## Product Scope

- Google Sign-In
- Home, Assessment, Infographic, Settings
- Admin overview and users management
- Light and dark mode
- Arabic and English
- File upload and document extraction
- Provider and model switching

Excluded from the initial build:

- Billing and unlock systems
- Inbox or communication center
- Live voice, chatbot, study tools, video generation
- Legacy Firebase Hosting + Cloud Run deployment assumptions as the default mental model

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

## Deployment Paths

- Active repo target: Firebase Hosting, with `firebase.json` pointing Hosting at `apps/web`
- `apps/web` remains the only canonical Next.js app inside the monorepo
- Legacy reference only: Firebase Hosting + Cloud Run
- App Hosting remains documented in the guide/history, but is not the active repo deployment config after this cleanup

Official Firebase docs currently say:
- Firebase Hosting framework support for Next.js is a preview path
- new participation in the Hosting frameworks experiment is closed
- Firebase recommends App Hosting for new full-stack Next.js apps

This repo keeps the requested Firebase Hosting-first ownership model for now, but tracks that official recommendation as an architectural risk.

## Environment

Important runtime groups:

- Public web env: `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_*`
- Server env: Firebase Admin credentials, admin email config, AI provider keys, Datalab credentials
- Firestore target: `zootopia-club-next-database`
